## Description

This Ansible role installs and configures **unattended-upgrades** on Ubuntu systems.  
It ensures that the system is kept up-to-date with security patches and optionally removes unused dependencies automatically.  
The role also configures systemd timers to activate automatic upgrade mechanisms reliably.

### Features:

- Installs the `unattended-upgrades` package
- Configures automatic daily updates and upgrades
- Enables removal of unused dependencies
- Ensures the `apt-daily-upgrade.timer` is enabled and running
- Uses a Jinja2 template for `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` to ensure reproducible, customizable configuration

## Role Variables

This role does not require custom variables for standard operation.  
All configuration values are defined in the template `50unattended-upgrades.j2` to provide secure defaults.  
However, you can override the template or define variables to adjust behavior if needed.

## Usage Example

```yaml
- name: Configure unattended upgrades
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: ansible_role_unattended_upgrades
```

## Sanity Checks

This role ensures:

- `unattended-upgrades` is installed
- `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades` is configured for daily checks and upgrades
- `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` is deployed via Jinja2 template
- `apt-daily-upgrade.timer` is enabled and active
- Removal of unused dependencies is enabled
